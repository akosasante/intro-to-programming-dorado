# How to: Create a Pull Request

## Step 1: Navigate to your repository and select the "Pull requests" tab

Note: You may or may not see the yellow section that says "Compare & pull request" on this page. This will usually show up if you have recently pushed a new branch to Github. It's okay if this part of the image does not match up with what you see in your repo, you will still be able to create a pull request from the "Pull Requests" tab.

## Step 2A: (If you see the yellow section in the image below) Click "Compare and pull request"

## Next Step

Copy the URL to the pull request you just created and follow this tutorial for submitting your assignment: [View instructions](../common/how-to-submit.md)

While the PR is open, you can `git push` new commits to it (for example, if your reviewer gives you feedback for your assignment), you should see them automatically show up in the PR.

Once the assignment has been reviewed, you can click "Merge pull request" at the bottom. This will merge your assignment branch into the `main` branch in your repo.
